In his article “Community Histories, Community Archives: Some Opportunities and Challenges”, Andrew Flinn discusses the definition of a community archive, explains the impact that minority histories have on all of our histories, and argues for the importance of preserving community archives with the same importance as a mainstream archive. The MIT Black Experience Oral History Project presents us with the unique opportunity to preserve and present materials and oral histories recorded by the MIT Black community in a way that lets those minority voices tell their stories themselves. Flinn explains that typically these materials will get lost over time and never find their way into a formal archive, so we have the chance to use MIT’s platform to preserve these voices and share them outside of the MIT Black community. Flinn argues for the democratization of the formal archive as a way to ensure that these minority voices aren’t drowned and that they can become more inclusive, so this presents us with a challenge to make sure that our archive is democratized in a way such that the MIT Black community can continue to contribute to it and that MIT doesn’t drown out the new or old contributions. Overall, we should use MIT’s platform to share the voices, but remember to keep the Black community involved so that the archive can be democratised.
