Noah Lenstra covers problems that arise when well funded institutions try to represent marginalized communities. This is clearly the situation of the MIT Museum. We must keep in mind the following 2 points.

1. Insitutions must engage in meaningul community discussion. 

2. Recognize and support marginalized community leadership.

Lenstra provides the example in St. Louis when students made suggestions but none were ever acted upon. As an institution, if we ask for community suggestions, we MUST make sure that there is some action that comes from them to make sure the community feels seen and heard.

In the eBlackCU project, the project had greater impact due to social media. Consumers are undoubtedly on social media platforms, and we can meet the audience where they already are (aka notify people / spread information on Facebook or Instagram). This can also in turn lead to more community engagement.

In the case of the Danvile project, we should uplift leaders already deeply embedded in the community. If our goal is to support and reach marginalized communities, we shouldn't necessarily find a brand new pathway to reach people. We can pinpoint and talk to influential leaders that can help us properly frame and represent the community. We must also make sure that we give these leaders a proper voice and not overpower them (aka give them a platform to better reach their audience).

The major takeway is that there is no prescriptive solution. However, all of these solutions build off of trusting relationships and understanding the community. So, we must be sure that we first [a] listen to the wants of the MIT Black community and [b] take action from their suggestions before we proceed with launching our heritage project.
