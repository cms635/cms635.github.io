## Assignment 5 Reading - Brenda Ceja

In Wolfgang Ernst, "Archives in Transition," Ernst states, "The so-called cyberspace is not primarily about memory as cultural record but rather about a performative form of memory as communication . . . Archives become cybernetic systems. The aesthetics of fixed order is being replaced by permanent reconfigurability" (Ernst 99). This makes me think of how digital archives must be constantly updated. Ernst himself states, "Repositories are no longer final destinations but turn into frequently accessed sites" (Ernst 99). Digital archives in essence, must be flexible, communicative, and able to move with the changing times. Archives can became outdated, technologically obsolete, or disappear entirely. In relation to our class project, I think the MIT Black Experience can greatly benefit by being constantly updateable through new comments, questions, and submissions from users and MIT Black affliates.
