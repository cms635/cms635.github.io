In "Community Histories, Community Archives: Some Opportunities and Challenges," Andrew Flinn discusses the importance of community archives. Flinn writes that, "Community archives help communities not only to remember and document their past but also to understand the present day connections to the past" (159). In relation to the MIT Oral History Project, I think this is one of the project's most central goals. As we have noted in class before, there are recurring themes of the MIT Black experience from when these original interviews were conducted, to the current MIT Black experience of today. This is why I believe it is crucial we design an archival prototype which not just organizes existing audio, but makes it possible for the MIT Black community, and wider MIT community to engage with the audio via comments, catalogs, and for the Black community: personal submissions. This, I would argue, is part of the process of democratizing the archive.
