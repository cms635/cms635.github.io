I liked the approach to "crowd sourcing" that Owens gave in his article. I had honestly viewed the general public's contributions to archving/transcribing/support as unpaid labor (ie Mechanical Turks as a "digital sweatshop"). And after reading this paper, I left with a more hopeful perspective on engaging a communitiy around an archive. 

I am not sure how much we will be implementing crowd sourcing in the MIT Black Oral History Project, but here are a couple major takeaways I had that could be applicable.

1. If we employ people to help us transcribe/tag audio clips we should give them titles with dignity (ie example of "citizen scientists"). Maybe something exciting like MIT history volunteer scholar that signifies how much their contributions mean.

2. We should build tools that allow volunteer scholars to track the history of a certain individual. Like the example of the Civil War diaries, the act of transcribing/tagging can be more rewarding if a volunteer feels like they are sincerely learning another person's story. It will draw back volunteer scholars and keep engagment retention high.
