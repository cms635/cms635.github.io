In “THE DOMINANT, THE RESIDUAL AND THE EMERGENT IN ARCHIVAL IMAGINATION” Liang explores the relationship between residual value, dominant value (which I understood as what is ‘chosen’ to be remembered), and the emergent (how it is received by an audience). He discusses the evolution of the archive itself, from the days of dusty items to the collection of many pictures in the digital era. I’m not entirely sure that I quite grasped everything, but it made me think about how I perceive “value” in an archive. Value is subjective, but in an archive it is also dynamic, requiring some form of dominant value from the curator and an emergent value from the audience. The residual value is still important, since that gives yet another opportunity to articulate a narrative.

Liang also says that to create an archive is to creatively produce a concept. This also influenced my perception of ‘value,’ since the idea of producing a concept makes the archive seem much more dynamic, and almost never complete (suggesting the audience contribution to value brings it closer to completion). 

Applying some of these ideas to the MIT Black Oral History Project makes me really consider the audience participation and engagement in the archive. Without users giving the project the emergent value, I feel that the overall value of the narratives would be lost (also because they wouldn’t be heard). I also wonder if the audience also contributes to what might be considered the dominant value vs residual value, since ultimately, they are the ones exploring the archive and shaping their own experience.
