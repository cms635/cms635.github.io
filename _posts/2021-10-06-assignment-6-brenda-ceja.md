In "Dealing with the silence," Valerie Johnson dives into the different types of silences in the archives, and presents potential solutions to "fill the void" (101). While I understood the majority of this chapter, I was a bit confused by the notion of the false silence. From my understanding, the false silence is perhaps the idea that something is missing, and that that missing piece will solve the historical question at hand. Except there is no one easy way to solve the historical question. As Johnson writes, "Sometimes, the hard truth is that the evidence is not, and never was, there" (102). Later in the chapter, Johnson presents folk memory and traditions as a potential solution to "take the researcher back through time without the need for documents" (104).  

Johnson then continues onto the issue of 'false' voices in the archives. She asserts that archives are *a* truth, and "that it is not the whole or only truth" (103). In relation to the MIT Black Experience project, I believe this important to consider the types of voices featured in the project. How do social issues like class, desirability, and respectabilityty politics affect whose voices we hear from? Are MIT's Black neighbors in Cambridgeport considered part of the community? Are the voices of Black staff from dining to janitorial and clerical represented in the archive as well? 

These questions lead us to "acknowledging the silence as silence." As Burton writes, the archive is "'a history of loss'" (Burton, 2001) (105). Texts, folk memory, and a myriad of other formats all lose context the more they are passed on. There is also the loss of what does not make it into the archive. And what is never recorded. What are unique ways in which the MIT Black Experience can acknowledge the silence as silence? How can the silence be filled with alternative voices? I personally think that working with current students on this project is the best way forward for the University to trace the similarities of the MIT Black experience of the past, to the experience of today.
