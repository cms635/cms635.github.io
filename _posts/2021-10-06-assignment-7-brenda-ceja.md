In Lawerence Liang's, "The Dominant, the Residual and the Emergent in Archival Imagination," Liang uses Raymond William's framework of the characterization of culture "as the dominant, the residual, and the emergent" to argue that "the will to archive" creates a similar tension (2). He also suggests "the contingent" as an additional category "to how we think of contemporary archives" (2). Liang then writes, "If archives are a response to the question of the contingency of information, they are in turn marked by their own contingent relation to social, legal, political , and technological factors" (2). This immediately made me think of the social contexts for different periods of the MIT Black Experience and how those social, legal, and political factors affect the archival documents in which a user is engaging with.  

Liang's point to how "traditionally archives emerged in the context of power, control, and secrecy" (2) makes me reflect on the current Black MIT students who are unaware of the project's existence. How can we make sure archives are adequately publicized to the communities they are intended for? How can we ensure that communities are not gatekept audiences but active participants?  

I personally really enjoyed what Liang had to say about autonomous archives being "a response to the monopolization of public memory by the state" (10). This makes me think of zine archives, social media-based archives community-based archives, family archives, and archives that present a different view of history that the state does not have an interest in preserving. In my opinion, Liang's following points seem very applicable to contemporary archives in particular, stating that "autonomous archives . . . also render what is present, unstable" (10). I think there is great value in the stories of current Black affiliates at MIT that could add to the archive. Where are the stories of Black dining and janitorial staff? of the latest group of MIT Black students?
