Below are the side-by-side notes I had after listening to the first parts of interviews with Mildred Dresselhaus and Michael Feld.

I didn't realize before but both of them are white. They spent a long time talking about other Black MIT community members and their experiences growing up around minority groups. Because these interviewees were not Black themselves, I think it would be most powerful to have recommended links to profiles of the students they talked about. I often had to pause the audio to go look up the people the interviewees were discussing.

It was sometimes hard to deduce the historical context and attitudes towards diversity during the different interviews. I couldn't tell if it was a HUGE deal or not whether a person of color was inducted as a faculty member. And, I had to also look up some events like the Kent State riots from 1966-1970 to get a better understanding on the topics brough up.

After listening to the raw interviews I have 2 major takeaways:
1. We should definitely provide onscreen links to people talked about in the interviews. 
2. We should also include historical context for time periods being discussed - like Wikipedia links to major historical events outside of MIT.
