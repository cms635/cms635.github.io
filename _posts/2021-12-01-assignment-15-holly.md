I thought the two most relevant stories to our project were the eBlackCU and the “Pardon Me, Brother” stories. In the eBlackCU story, Lenstra found the biggest challenge was the community’s lack of autonomy from the local university. As a result, the community wasn’t involved in the early key decisions of the project and they didn’t fully embrace the project in its later stages. With the MIT Black Oral History Project, the community is a community within the university, yet the community still maintains a level of autonomy from the MIT administration (e.g. the yearly list of demands the BSU provides to administration). As such, the MIT Black community should be treated autonomously from the MIT institutional involvement with the project and be given a separate voice in the decisions we make. 
In the “Pardon Me, Brother” story, Lenstra found that what made the project successful was that it, “..grew out of the interest and energies of a leader deeply embedded in her community” (102). I believe our project has a similar strength as all of the interviews were collected by Clarence G. Williams and each interviewee was active in the MIT Black community in their time at MIT. Our materials hold value with the MIT Black community, we just need to make sure the community is still engaged with the archiving, presenting, and growing of these materials. 
Other possibilities to create “intensive community engagement” for our project at MIT could include partnering with the BSU to hold “listening parties” or discussions around the interviews, or maybe even a sort of “continuing the interview” event with former interviewees who are still at MIT. These types of events could also give us feedback and input from the community as well as engagement with them.
