In his article “Digital Cultural Heritage and the Crowd”, Trevor Owens discusses the issues with the traditional definitions of “crowd” and “sourcing” in the context of cultural heritage and provides four considerations for his new framework of crowdsourcing. Owens argues that rather than approaching crowdsourcing as a way of extracting work from a large amount of people as we would in the business sense of the term, we should treat crowdsourcing as an opportunity to allow amateur participation in work that benefits the public good. 

Owens provides four considerations for his framework of this approach: “...human computation; the wisdom of crowds; thinking of tools and software as scaffolding; and the psychology of participant motivation” (123). In the first consideration, he argues that rather than using humans to do labor that computers could easily do, we should use human computation to provide data that a computer could not and enhance the computer-generated results. In the second consideration, he explains why humans feel the need to be consulted and how that can empower someone through their participation in crowdsourcing. In the third consideration, he suggests that we should use tools and scaffolding to provide users with enough support that they can make valuable contributions regardless of their expertise in the subject. In his final consideration, he explains the value that humans get from participating in something larger than their own life. 

In the context of the MIT Black Oral History Project, we should definitely abandon the traditional crowdsourcing definition and take Owens’ more ethical approach, especially since there is a historical issue of Black people being tasked with educating non-Black people on historical and current issues regarding the Black community. This project should be an opportunity for people to educate themselves through their own explorations, so we should have enough scaffolding and tools so that people are properly able to educate themselves without creating extra labor for the Black community. One idea to get unique human input on the data that isn’t something a computer can easily provide would be to have people annotate audio clips with what emotions they hear or feel themselves throughout the clip. This could force users to understand the clips in a different level of depth than simply transcribing, provide us with unique human computation, and give people a sense that they’ve contributed something unique and valuable to the project.
