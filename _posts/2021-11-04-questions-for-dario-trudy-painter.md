title: Questions for Dario - Trudy Painter

Core problems I see: We are concerned with maintaining the linear integrity of a speaker's story. For example, we want to preserve showing earlier snippets feeding into later snippets. However, we also want to include other components of interviews/speakers in the visualization. For example, we are considering affinities of 

a. time period

b. speakers that knew each other

c. similar topic/themes discussed

d. question asked by the interviewer (a common one was "tell me about your childhood")

1. How do you recommend that we preserve linear integrity of seqeuntial interview snippets without turning our visualization into a "plate of spaghetti"?

2. Which affinity do you think is the most important to visualize? 

3. Did you ever change your design after receiving feedback from the scholars involved? Was their feedback ususally the same or different?
