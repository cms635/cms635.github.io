In “Digital Cultural Heritage and the Crowd,” Owens describes crowdsourcing as inviting interested amateurs (non-professionals) to participate in a project. He considers four aspects of crowdsourcing: human computation, wisdom of crowds, providing support to these crowds to make contributing easier, and the psychology of these amateurs. 

Owen’s explanation and examples of crowdsourcing helped me reconstruct the idea of public participation that I initially had. More importantly, I realized that the ways in which the public participates in projects heavily depends on the intended audience, and strategically designing activities that cater to people who are actually interested rather than creating some activity that just passes time and mildly encourages engagement with the content. If the activity contributes to the overall project, then it could also make the user contributing feel good, which I can relate to a lot (it’s like helping out with the huge puzzles in the libraries on campus).

In our MIT Black Oral History project, I wonder if the audience can engage in a meaningful way by approving tags on certain soundbytes or drawing connections that might have not been obvious. I still like the idea of allowing people to make their own collection, but it would be nice to find a way to make it more significant to the community, rather than just a personal project. In addition, when implementing these ideas into our project, the level of moderation and crowd surveillance should be considered. I’m not sure if that already has some solution, but it would be better to keep in mind when designing features for community contribution (i.e. a comment section vs a multiple choice poll).
