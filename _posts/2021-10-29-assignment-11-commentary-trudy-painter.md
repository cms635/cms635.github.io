title: Assignment 11 Commentary - Trudy Painter
---
The biggest point I took away from Shilton and Srinivasan's paper was that when creating archives for marginalized communities we need to move AWAY from "archives _about_ rather than _of_ the communities."

So, we need to add another goal to our archive - "preserve the articulation of community identity." Documents lose elements of their meaning if they are separated from the context of their creation. So, we need to make sure that we provide contextual value to the interviews _as the community understands it_.

For the Black Oral History project, this then raises an important challenge. If we follow the advice from this paper, we must involve Black MIT community members in the archival arrangement and description of events to properly preserve the context of the interviews. I propose that we make a call to have volunteers review and give feedback of our first prototypes. Black MIT community members will give us the most accurate criticism on the presentation of their experiences.
