In their article “Participatory Appraisal and Arrangement for Multicultural Archival Collections”, Katie Shilton and Ramesh Srinivasan propose techniques for the creation of representative archives. One of their concepts that we’ve discussed within the context of the MIT Black Experience Oral History Project is the idea of avoiding objectifying the materials and displaying the “other”. They suggest using empowered narratives or, “...records and histories spoken directly by traditionally marginalized communities, embedded within the local experience, practice, and knowledge of that community,” (90) to avoid the “other” and allow the archive to accurately represent the community. Another technique to avoid the “other” they discussed was arranging records and context in a way that, “...actively empower the records, projecting voices spoken by and for the community that reflect the original context and knowledge structures of their community creation” (94). For our project, using the audio interviews as our primary material allows us to create an archive where the community literally speaks for itself, but we still need to figure out how we can contextualize the materials for the user so that we avoid the “other”. One easy way of providing context from the computational splitting of the audios would be making sure each audio is connected to its speaker, the question or answer to a question, similar questions and answers, and any relevant information about the speaker.
