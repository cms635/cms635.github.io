Flinn's article gives a comprehensive overview of the history of different types of community archives and the most important current conversations around archival preservation. There were a few main points that Flinn made that I think have a direct correlation to the MIT Black Experience Oral History Project.

1.**Technological advances empower previously silenced voices.** Flinn raises the point that websites and fast Internet communication both connect archivists and give a platform for marginalized communities to share their story. We should keep in mind that our website does not have to be limited to a physical space (like a museum restrained to people within driving/walking distance). We could be reaching people from all over the world and we should tailor our website to meet the audience's familiarity with MIT and the Black Experience.

2.**Community archives illuminate intimicacies past macro-scale statistics.** The beauty of community archives is that they are made and curated by people with first-hand experience with the story being told. Often, official records can minimize people's life stories to data points and statistics. However, intimate media objects like audio and photographs bring a more humanizing affect to community archives. We can leverage this increased intimacy in the Black Oral History project to engage listeners and more effectively share the Black Experience at MIT.
