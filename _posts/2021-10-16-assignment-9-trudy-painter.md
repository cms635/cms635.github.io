Ellen Lupton's chapters in "Design is Storytelling" provide an effective framework for thinking about the user first. We have been focusing on how we can link the data together through a dynamic archival framework but have not yet thought about HOW the user will experience this data. By thinking of the user's interaction with the Black Oral History data as a story with a buildup, climax, and resolution, we can start to think of website design to replicate this user experience.

I think for the Black Oral History we should think of our platform not as storytelling but storyBUILDING. I think it will be most powerful for users to indepdently and cirtically construct a perspective of MIT through:

[a] historical context and example stories provided by us (the designers)
[b] exploring audio snippets at either a macro scale (high volume of short stories with similar topic/theme) or at a micro scale (intimately follow one person's experience)

I also liked Carlos Sora's diagram about how a user can move through data points. I think it will be a good visual aid for us to plan how we want to corral users through audio snippets/discovery.
