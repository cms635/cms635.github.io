Ellen Lupton describes three essential tools for building a story: the narrative arc, the hero’s journey, and the storyboard. Lupton considers many tactics that both storytelling and design have in common, and how to utilize them to build action in a story. I particularly like this emphasis on the importance of action in storytelling and design: “Action is at the heart of interaction.” 

In terms of the project, it would be good to build an overall storyboard to frame the general experience that we want each user to have while interacting with the archive. After listening to some of the interviews, I think that the topics and discussion should be split into three parts: life before MIT, life at MIT, and life after MIT. This gives the user some sort of media to interact with and helps them create an unique experience while still following the story that is being told. The audio clips themselves should give action and dialogue to the story, which could be designed in a way such that life at MIT is the climax of the story.
