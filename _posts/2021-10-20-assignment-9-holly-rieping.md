In the excerpts from Ellen Lupton’s book Design is Storytelling, she discusses various tools used in storytelling and how each provides different insight on a user’s experience and understanding. I liked her explanation of the design process: “At the start of the creative process, designers ask what a product or service can do for people--and what people can do with it” (21). In our project, we can use Lupton’s audience or user-based perspective to figure out what story we want to tell to best serve our users. I also think that storyboards and wireframes would be incredibly useful tools for us as we go forward designing what the experience might look and feel like. 

In his talk, Carles Sora discussed some core principles of digital storytelling (procedural, participatory, spatial, and encyclopedic) and explained how he modified them for his work (and introduced the new principle of atemporal narratives) as well as gave thorough examples of these principles. In our project, I believe the procedural aspect can be done in the background of the experience so that the material speaks to the user more than the computer algorithms being used to sort through material or find connections. The participatory aspect could be as simple as the user actively selecting what audio they want to listen to or as complex as allowing the user to annotate or tag the audios. We’ve touched on the spatial aspect a bit in class already, but I think we could do something really unique if we focus on using this aspect to find a creative way to visualize audio. 

One similarity I found in both Lupton’s book and Sora’s talk was the idea that the story should ask a question first and tell the answer through the journey or exploration. So, on our homepage, we should make sure that we pose some type of question to our users (either an explicit question we ask or an implied question through our design that leads a user to explore) so that they have something to guide them on their experience.
