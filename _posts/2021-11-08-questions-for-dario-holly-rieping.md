1. In our project, I could imagine a situation where our nodes are speakers or our nodes are individual audio clips. Or maybe even a situation where a satellite represents a speaker, but zooming in would show nodes of individual audio clips. Do you have any advice for how we should select our nodes for the best user-experience?
2. Our audience is more than just the speakers in the interviews, itâ€™s the general MIT community. I found the idea of self-recognition interesting in your work, and was wondering if you might have any advice for leading our users to having some form of self-recognition (i.e. how their own MIT experience relates or maybe how starkly different their experience has been) while they explore the interviews? 
3. What techniques did you find led to having the best transparency in your process? You mentioned having professors being active contributors to the project and validating the affinity map through interviews.
