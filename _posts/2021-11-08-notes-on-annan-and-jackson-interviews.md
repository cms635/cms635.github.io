title: Notes on Annan and Jackson Interviews
author: Holly Rieping

Here are links to notes I took on the [Kofi Annan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fOyGIUTxkbbUlbWoX9SRTQDHvV3mawrY/view?usp=sharing) and [Shirley Ann Jackson](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1mRJAvEyJGfVPfu7pT1VfpClUqes9FV/view?usp=sharing) interviews. They're also uplaoded as PDFs to the Google Drive folder.

One thing that really stood out to me personally in Shirley Ann Jackson's interview is how different her experience living in McCormick was from my experience. Her isolation and lonliness was a stark contrast to the welcoming, incredibly diverse McCormick I know. It was really interesting hearing her experience and knowing with confidence that at least that aspect of MIT has changed for the better.
